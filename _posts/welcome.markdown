Today, I am formally announcing the release of Not Another Data Engineering Blog! (NADEBLG!). I have thought about the best ways to approach this new endeavor, what I want to write about and discuss, and most of all, who is the audience I am trying to reach. Before my first technical post, we must first  do a little house keeping, or said another way, we must lay the foundation for the articles to follow. 

The goals of this little blog, are to document what I am learning! From tools, to techniques, to research and books I am reading, to rants and interviewing for the next data engineering adventure. The holistic intent to any and everything data engineering (with a tinge of flexibility to discuss other interesting topics). With that in mind, this blog is more about documenting my journey, and if I can help other like-minded souls to learn something new, then we can all sleep easy at night (or the early morning if you are a night owl like myself). So, without further ado, let me list a taste of the upcoming content I plan to post and discuss: 

1. Current reading list (books, article, blog, etc.)
2. Current tech I am using or learning to use
3. Current techniques I am using
4. Interview questions & answers (with code where applicable)
5. SubReddits that I am following (and maybe commenting or contributing to)
6. Rants about the industry or other related topics

Now, we are off. Off to explore the wide and fasinating world of data engineering, one byte at a time. Thank you for joining.

Cheers!         
Jason
